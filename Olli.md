**Create to Destroy:**
> When you **use available materials to rig up a dangerous device**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you cobble together something that will do what you want, one time. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. The device is:
>
> - More dangerous than intended
> - Larger or more unwieldy than intended
> - More temperamental and fragile than intended
>
> On a miss, you need some vital component to finish it; the GM will tell you what.

**Danger Mask:**
> You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work - more of a calling card, an identifier of "the real you," than a disguise. Treat it as a piece of equipment with two boxes of wear. While you have your mask on, any notoriety you gain is doubled, any prestige you gain is halved, and take +1 to **trust fate** and all Scoundrel playbook moves. If your mask is ever taken from you, mark exhaustion. If your mask is ever destroyed, mark 4-exhaustion. If your mask is destroyed, you can make a new mask when time passes.

## Backstory

- **Olli** was born in a small fishing town
- Even before the **second war** broke out, the **Riverfolk** saw potential in the location and planned to build a dam
- The townspeople were forced to work on the dam. But most were content with the situation because it finally meant some consistent income. **Ollis family** felt the same. They were happy to work even if the working conditions were rough
- About a year into the project the dam was coming along nicely. The townsfolk were falling into poverty but they were promised once the dam was finished they would profit from the renewed trade. At this time the **second war** had already been going on for quite some time
- One day a big tragedy befell the site of construction. A raging fire caused great destruction and many workers - including **Ollis parents** - fell victim to the flames
- The townspeople are disheartened but the **Riverfolk** decide that the dam must be finished
- At first **Olli** reluctantly agrees to continue working but finds signs that the fire might not have been caused by an accident. They try to convince their fellow workers that the **Riverfolk** was to blame, but few listen
- After failing to convice them using their words, a few members of the **Corvid Conspiracy** approached **Olli**
- They hit it off and **Olli** decides to travel with them for a while. Feeling more at home with the crows than they did back home they create a persona, always wearing a mask on their heists
- These were the most influential years of **Ollis** life. They were one of the youngest members and their time with the crows shaped who **Olli** would later become
- For about two years **Olli** gained some infamy. While not rising in the ranks of the **Corvid Conspiracy** they find a few likeminded teenagers who also weren't scared to take drastic measures
- By this time **Olli** had been fully radicalized. They believed that the big factions would do anything in their power to stay on top and that the only way to end the suffering of the people was to attack the establishment at their weak points. At this point they were so convinced of their beliefs that they'd do anything to harm the factions. Not even thinking about who their actions might also hurt
- One day **Olli** went to the site of one of the factories of the **Marquis** wherethey met an older grey go-away-bird called **Arson** who held a speach trying to rally the townsfolk to their cause
- They were dumbfounded by this approach. While **Arson** seemed to share most of their beliefs, **Olli** had long given up on trying to peacefully convince others to join their quest. But for some reason **Arson** had a way of reaching the people. Something **Olli** could never manage to do
- After the speach **Olli** approached them and tried to hire their help for the planned atttack on the nearby factory
- They immidiatly hit it off. Apparently **Arson** had also been a part of the **Corvid Conspiracy** in the past and **Olli** was glad to hear that they would also not shy away from using drastic measures to fight against the system of oppresion
- **Arson** agreed to help with the attack under the condition that it would be carried out at night so no workers would be harmed. **Olli** was just happy to work with them and together they convinced the rest of **Ollis** allies to change the time of the attack
- Together they successfully rigged up an explosive to destroy the factory beyond repair. Afterwards they were celebrating their victory and **Olli** was ecstatic to have found a partner and a friend
- In a drunken moment of enthusiasm **Olli** asked **Arson** to rejoin the **Conspiracy** when all of the sudden the mood dropped and **Arson** got serious
- They explained why they couldn't go back to the **Corvid Conspiracy** and how even when working against the system one should never forget their morals
- This was the first time **Olli** had reflected on their previous actions. In an honest attempt at understanding - very much unlike them - **Olli** kept probing **Arson** for their perspectives and reasoning for doing what they were doing
- While **Arson** was explaining their disagreements with the **Corvid Conspiracy** they were dropping a few anecdotes of times the **Conspiracy** went to far
- And listening to them **Olli** began to pick up enough clues to realize that maybe the accident at the dam might not have been an accident after all
- Over the next couple of days **Olli** starting questioning more and more of what they did in the past and if it truly helped the people of the forest or if it was just a way to get back at the major powers without any perspective
- When even their closest friends started calling **Olli** soft and shut down any inquire about what exactly might have happened in their hometown, **Olli** finally decided to split from the **Corvid Conspriracy**
- At first **Olli** thought of joining **Arson** but after having blindly followed others for so long they decided to work alone for a while
- So until today **Olli** kept trying to figure out if the **Corvid Conspiracy** was truly responsible for the attack on the dam or if it was the **Riverfolk** like they had believed for so long
- Even when working alone **Olli** didn't shy away from using explosives to fight the big factions but they tried their hardest not to put others in harms way. Even starting to offer help in a less destructive form
- From time to time they and **Arson** would still meet up, share their beliefs and even attack other pieces of infrastructure, but other than that **Olli** was unsure whether they could ever join another group in fear of being betrayed by them again
